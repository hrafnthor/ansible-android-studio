For version numbers and their associated checksums seem the archives [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/archive).

### Defaults

By default the clients will be installed under `/opt/android/studio` as defined by the default variable `android_studio_default_path`, unless the variable `android_studio.location.path` is given.

By default the location of the environment variables file is `/etc/profile.d/android.sh` as defined by the default variable `android_studio_default_environment_path`, unless the variable `android_studio.environment.location.path` is given. 

By default all directories created will be owned by the user running the role, unless configured differently using variables such as `android_studio.location.owner | .group` or `android_studio.environment.location.owner | .group`. They are also given chmod `0755` by default.

By default the desktop file is placed at `/usr/share/applications` as defined by the default variable `android_studio_default_desktop_file_path`.

By default the symlinks are placed in `/usr/bin` as defined by the default variable `android_studio_default_symlink_path`, unless the variable `android_studio.(primary | canary).symlink.path` is given.


## Dependencies

None.

## Setup

Before the role can be used it needs to be added to the machine running the playbook, and as of writing this, this role is not hosted on Ansible-Galaxy only on Github.

1. Create a `requirements.yml` file in the root directory of the playbook being worked on.

2. Add the following definition inside the `requirements.yml` file:

```yml
- name: hth-android-studio
  src: https://github.com/hrafnthor/ansible-android-studio.git
  scm: git
```

3. Install the requirements by executing 

```shell
ansible-galaxy install -r .requirements.yml
``` 

This will allow any playbook run from this machine to use the role `hth-android-studio`


## Example Playbook

The following playbook installs two clients. Each is installed to the default location, but with guid `developers`. One client is configured as the primary studio client, while the other one is set as the canary client. Each are given custom descriptive names and keywords. The canary client is symlinked only for user `Hrafn`. The environment file is create only for user `Hrafn`, with one incorrect value being removed.
